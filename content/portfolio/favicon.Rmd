I'm a big fan of blogdown. It's tricky to set up in the first place getting a theme right and deploying it (with the help of Amber Thomas's [fantastic blog](http://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/)), but I'm really impresed with how flexible it is. 

With my new blogdown, I decided I wanted to change the default icon that appears on your browser tab (which I later found out is called a favicon), but couldn't find any guidence on how to do this with blogdown. Lot's of googling and <b style="color:#FF0000";>HTML nightmares</b> later, here's what I found. 

<font size="5"><b style="color:#8E44AD";>1.  Find an image you'd like to have as your favicon</b></font>

Now go to a website that can turn your image into the `favico.ico` format. I used the [favicon-generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and for this blog post, I've just used an MIT licensed logo [found here on pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/copyright-free-logo-cc0-license-pd-31208/). 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/fav_generator.png")
```
   
Now move this file over to this part of your folder structure and save: 

`your_blog_name/static/img`

<font size="5"><b style="color:#8E44AD";>2.  Now to change your HTML</b></font>

In my theme, I went to the folder and opened up the `head.html` file in the folder structure:

`your_blog_name/themes/your_theme_name/layouts/partials`

Open up this folder to edit, and add this line of code to your blog 

```html
<link rel="icon" href="{{ "img/favicon.ico" | absURL }}" type="image/x-icon">
```

Save this and then run `blogdown::build_site()` and your new favicon should be on your browser tab like so! **Disclaimer: it may take a minute or so to decide to work, keep building the site a few more times if it's being stubborn!**
