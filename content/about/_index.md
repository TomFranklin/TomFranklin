I graduated with a BSc in Economics at the Univeristy of Manchester in 2016, where I learned that I really enjoyed the statistics and econometrics elements of my degree. 

My dissertation was based on panel data modelling in STATA of the now-discontinued British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), combined with ONS house price estimates to see if changes housing affordability affected subjective well-being in the UK. It was titled "The keys to happiness. Does housing affordability affect subjective well-being?" My analysis counter-intuitively suggested it didn't! 

I then went on to work at the General Medical Council for a year, working as a data modelling analyst. There I learned all about programming in R, scripting in SQL and developing really cool viz's in tableau in our risk based regulatory work to improve patient safety. 

I've now worked at the Department for Education for a year and really enjoy my job, working on making shiny web applications in R for official and national statistical releases and on the automation of statistical releases.
